# Layers

**Layers** is a personal blog and a corner of my web backyard where I share my inspiration, raw ideas, unfinished dreams, projects I wonâ€™t do, unfiltered thoughts, half-formed concepts, untouched potential, things I like, creative process, personal matters, nonsense, things that donâ€™t always fit into a polished, finished format, and anti-perfectionism.
