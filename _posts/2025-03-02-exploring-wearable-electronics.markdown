I've been working on an exciting new project that combines electronics, and wearable accessories. The idea is to create two necklaces that interact with each other when they come close—maybe by lighting up with a unique LED sequence.

#### The Concept

The main idea is to use sensors like RFID or magnetic sensors to detect when the necklaces are near each other. When they get close, a light pattern would play using small LEDs. I’m aiming for a simple, beautiful, and meaningful interaction between the two pieces.

#### Current Progress

**Sensor Ideas:** Considering RFID or magnetic sensors to trigger the interaction.
**LED Control:** Exploring the use of a 4017 decade counter with a 555 timer to create light sequences. SMD components will keep the design small and wearable.

**Microcontroller Option:** Thinking about using the CH32V003, a small 8-pin microcontroller, to add more flexibility with light patterns and power management.

**Power Source:** A CR2032 coin cell battery seems like a good fit, but power efficiency is a big focus to ensure the necklaces can last.

#### What’s Next?

There’s still a lot to figure out! I need to finalize the sensor choice, test the battery life, and refine the LED patterns. and see where this project goes.
