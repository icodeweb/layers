In 2020 I made a two-minute video for an [electronic music track](https://hizzme.bandcamp.com/track/condition-monitor). It was a mashup of 80s and 90s tech ads—cassette players, cars, TVs, computers, CDs, and all kinds of stuff.

Just cut-up commercials and tech nostalgia.

Nobody liked it back then except me and then the whole project got lost, and all I had left was a low-quality 352×288 3GPP 5.6 MB file.

Today, I uploaded it to YouTube because I want to keep sharing things—especially if I liked them and because why not.

I have a video on YouTube now.
