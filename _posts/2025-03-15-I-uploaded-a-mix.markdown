In 2020, I made a music mix—lo-fi and rough, but I loved it.  
Back then, I was deep into vaporwave, deathdream, and all that kind of stuff. It was the COVID era—gloomy days.  

Nobody cared for it back then. It never got released, nobody heard it, and I had no idea where it went all these years. Today, I found it on an old, abandoned hard drive.  

The mix is called *ṃ̸̼̉̊͑̅́̍̆̃̆ͅa̴̛̛̲͌̿̔̌͘d̷͔̈́́̃͜͝e̷̓̆͑͘͝ ì̵̍͛̈̽̕̚͝ͅn̷͎̔̋̓́͐̅̈́͠ a̸̗̖̓̕n̶̫̓̂g̵͔̍̇͊͆́͝͝͝ë̵̝́̓̓r̷̓̽*. I first called it *Crystal Clear*, but later changed it.  

The cover is a close-up of a Creative sound card, packed with IC chips.

So I decided to put it on YouTube today.
